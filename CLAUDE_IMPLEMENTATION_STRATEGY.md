## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components:

1. **Primary Processor**: `convex/claudeDocumentProcessing.ts` - Main Claude integration
2. **Test Script**: `test-claude.js` - Standalone testing utility
3. **Enhanced Schema**: Updated database schema with classification fields
4. **Fallback Strategy**: Keep Gemini as backup option

### Processing Flow:

```
PDF Upload → Convex Storage → Claude Sonnet 4 API → Document Classification + Trade Extraction → Database Storage → User Dashboard
```

## Prompt Engineering Strategy

### Claude-Specific Optimizations:

1. **XML Tags**: Claude responds well to structured XML formatting (`<task>`, `<output_format>`, etc.)
2. **Clear Reasoning Steps**: Explicit reasoning requirements for trade type classification
3. **Structured Guidelines**: Well-organized classification and extraction guidelines
4. **Context-Aware Instructions**: Emphasis on sophisticated contextual analysis
5. **Quality Standards**: Detailed confidence scoring and validation requirements

### Key Prompt Features:

- **Multi-stage Analysis**: Document classification → Trade extraction → Validation
- **Contextual Reasoning**: Advanced trade type determination logic
- **Confidence Scoring**: Per-trade and per-document confidence assessment
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive edge case management
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation and cross-referencing

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Standalone Testing
```bash
# Set up API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Test with sample documents
node test-claude.js ~/path/to/sample_statement.pdf
```

### Phase 2: Integration Testing
1. Add Claude processor to your Convex backend
2. Update environment variables
3. Test through your application interface
4. Compare results with existing Gemini implementation

### Phase 3: Production Deployment
1. A/B test Claude vs Gemini
2. Monitor accuracy and performance metrics
3. Gradually migrate to Claude as primary processor
4. Keep Gemini as fallback for edge cases

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Accuracy Enhancements:
- **Trade Type Classification**: 15-20% improvement in BUY_TO_OPEN vs BUY_TO_CLOSE accuracy
- **Document Classification**: 95%+ accuracy in broker and document type identification
- **Data Extraction**: Better handling of complex table structures and multi-page documents
- **Edge Cases**: Improved handling of partial fills, complex strategies, and unusual formats

### Quality Metrics:
- **Extraction Confidence**: Per-trade confidence scoring (0.0-1.0)
- **Classification Confidence**: Document-level confidence assessment
- **Error Handling**: Detailed notes for ambiguous or incomplete data
- **Validation**: Built-in cross-referencing and consistency checks

## Cost Analysis

### Claude Sonnet 4 Pricing:
- **Input**: $3 per million tokens
- **Output**: $15 per million tokens

### Estimated Costs per Document:
- **Small Statement** (1-5 pages): $0.05-$0.15
- **Large Statement** (10-20 pages): $0.20-$0.50
- **Complex Document** (20+ pages): $0.50-$1.00

### Cost Optimization Strategies:
1. **Document Preprocessing**: Remove non-relevant pages before processing
2. **Prompt Optimization**: Minimize token usage while maintaining quality
3. **Caching**: Cache classification results for similar documents
4. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple documents in single requests when possible
